## Ghost of Damocles
`GameJam Project` `Unity`

Game made using Unity for the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi's game jam : WonderJam 2021 (48h)

You embody a young traveler greedy for gold and wealth but who is bound to a damned ghost.<br/>
The only way to free yourself from this curse is to explore a castle full of horrible monsters in order to find how to break up the link between him and the ghost of damocles.

The theme imposed by the gamejam was: "The Connection"<br/>
The styles imposed by the gamejam were : Platformer - Horror - Management
