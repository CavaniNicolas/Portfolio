## Ghost of Damocles
`GameJam Project` `Unity` `2021`

You embody a young traveler greedy for gold and wealth but who is bound to a damned ghost.<br/>

## Combat des animaux
`Personnal Project` `C` `SDL2` `2019`

Redoing a street fighter game in C, 60 hours project, 2019<br/>
This project uses SDL2 (more precisely SANDAL2, a SDL2 overlay).<br/>
The whole interface is responsive to the window size, this does not add anything to the game but I had fun coding an optimized disposition of the characters in the menu (in other words : an auto filling menu).<br/>
I also drew the character's animation myself, which is why its not good, but it was to have fun with spritesheets and SDL.
